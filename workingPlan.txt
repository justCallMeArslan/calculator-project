// 2 bugs and 2 features to be done:

// 1. allowing second operator to append, instead of calculate (10-6, push 4 should give 4+ bNumber)
// 2 if a becomes negative number operation stops
// 3. adding on-screen keyboard in place of 00 button
// 4. add background of school table with school stationery
