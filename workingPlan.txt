// 2 bugs and 2 features to be done:

// 1. allowing second operator to append, instead of calculate (10-6, push 4 should give 4+ bNumber)
// 2 if a becomes negative number operation stops
// 3. adding on-screen keyboard in place of 00 button
// 4. add background of school table with school stationery
// 5. after equation done, next digit input should clear output window and set new aNumber
// 6. if mistaken with operator i should be able to change + on - , without backspace and just by 
// pressing -
// 7. 8 x0 gives NaN instead of "Error"
